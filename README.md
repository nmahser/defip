# DeFi Platform
The goal of this project to create a platform which includes DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications, such as crypto margin trading and lending. As a starting point
we'll be implementing a token swap powered by Kyber's smart contracts



## Instalation / Preparation
`git clone https://github.com/nmahser/defip.git` <br>
`cd defip` <br>
`npm install`<br>
`npm run` <br>

### Notes
We can consider this version as a prototype for token swaps. You can buy and sell tokens on the main net. The app doesn't work on Ropsten Network (Test Net) because ERC20 tokens addresses are different in the main and test nets.
